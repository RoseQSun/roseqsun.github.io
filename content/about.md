I am a student researcher passionate about creating the next generation of technology for music.

Currently, I am pursuing my master's degree in Music Technology at Georgia Tech, where I am an active member of the Computational and Cognitive Musicology Lab. My ongoing master's thesis focuses on objective evaluation of deep learning models in music generation.

I received my Bachelor’s in Music Technology from Georgia Tech in 2022. I worked as an undergraduate research assistant in the Robotic Musicianship Lab, where I worked on FOREST and the Drumming Arm.

My broad interest in music and engineering has led me to various projects in robotics, computational ethnomusicology, digital signal processing, interactive systems, and music perception. I am also a flautist with a repertoire in classical, rock and pop, and experimental music.

I serve as the President for Women in Music Tech @ Georgia Tech, where I help create a community for women to share information, socialize, and support each other. ​​​​​​​
